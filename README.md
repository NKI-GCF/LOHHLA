Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Losing the ability to present productive tumor neoantigens could facilitate evasion from immune predation. 
An integral part of neoantigen presentation is the HLA class I molecule, which presents epitopes to T-cells on the cell surface. Thus, loss of an 
HLA allele, resulting in HLA homozygosity, may be a mechanism of immune escape. However, the polymorphic nature of the HLA locus precludes accurate
copy number calling using conventional copy number tools.  
Here, we present **LOHHLA**, **L**oss **O**f **H**eterozygosity in **H**uman **L**eukocyte **A**ntigen, a computational tool to evaluate HLA loss 
using next-generation sequencing data.
